hate speech, bigotry, and personal attacks are not allowed.**\n\n**Death threats and telling others to kill themselves will result in a ban.**\n\nThis is pretty self explanatory.\n\n_____\n\n\n##Rule 3: Follow the correct format\n\n\n**Two line joke over a re-usable character.** \n\nWe understand that some established memes do not follow this format, such as \n\n* [What Year Is It?](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/what-year-is-it)\n\n* [I Should Buy a Boat Cat](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-should-buy-a-boat-cat)\n\n* Etc\n\nHowever, these memes are already well established and thus have been grandfathered in.\n\n**Not all image macros are memes**\n\n&gt;Meme -\n\n&gt;/m\u0113m/\n\n&gt;noun\n\n&gt;an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means, esp. imitation.\n\n&gt;[source](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/meme)\n\nBasically if the image is only relevant to one's own submission and can't be re-used (or has limited re-usability) then it's just an image macro and by definition not a meme.\n\n* [This is an example of a generic image macro.](https://i.imgur.com/LT1Fi3N.jpg)\n\nand\n\n* [This is an example of a meme.](https://i.imgur.com/871gSb7.jpg)\n\nMemes are allowed on the subreddit here, while generic image macros are better suited for /r/funny. \n\n_____\n\n##Rule 4: Don't repost\n\n**Don't post stuff you found from elsewhere on the web, it's probably been here already.**\n\nThis subreddit is for original content only, meaning memes YOU made. \n\nDo not resubmit your post because it did poorly. \n\nReposting is a bannable offense.\n\nIf you see a repost please report it as such, and [send a quick note to the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAdviceAnimals&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;subject=I+found+a+repost&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;message=Here+is+a+link+to+the+comment+section+of+the+repost:%0D%0A%0DAnd+here+is+proof+that+it+is+a+repost:) if you can.\n\n____\n\n##Rule 5: No Cake Day Posts\n\n**Cake Day posts are not allowed.**\n\nPosts that mention Cake Day in the title, or in the post itself will be removed.\n\n____\n\n\n##Rule 6: Verticals, Puffins and Batman Slaps\n\n**Please do not post Verticals, Opinion Puffins or Batman Slaps.**\n\nVerticals are multiple panel memes or image macros and both are better suited for either /r/funny or /r/vertical.\n\n* [This is an example of a vertical meme.](http://i.imgflip.com/bhnki.jpg)\n\n* [This is an example of a vertical image macro](https://i.imgur.com/UrHut.jpg)\n\nThis also means posts such as [9/11 Lois](http://i.imgur.com/DxdSLIo.jpg) aren't allowed; and memes such as [Nobody cares Nedry](http://i.imgur.com/P4KwK1i.jpg) and [Confused Gandalf](http://i.imgur.com/TKujvA3.jpg) are limited to their 1 panel standard, instead of their alternate vertical counterparts.\n\n2 AdviceAnimals in a vertical are OK.\n\nMeaning combining 2 established memes together such as [Socially Awkward Penguin](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/socially-awkward-penguin) and [Socially Awesome Penguin](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/socially-awesome-penguin) is fine.\n\n[Here is an example of its acceptable use](https://i.imgur.com/SRYGJdo.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n* [This is unpopular opinion puffin](http://i.imgur.com/qs4z4Rm.jpg)\n\n* [This is an example of a Batman Slap](https://i.imgur.com/5rrb52F.jpg)\n\n_____\n\n\n##Rule 7: Link directly to your image\n\n**Make sure you link directly to your image.**\n\nIn other words, not just to the website, or the gallery page.\n\nHere are a few examples.\n\n* OK.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wdLOqmx.png\n\n\n* Not OK.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/wdLOqmx\n\nhttp://imgur.com/memegen\n\nhttp://makeameme.org/newest\n\n\n_____\n\n\n##Rule 8: People you know\n\n**Don't make memes with pics of people that you saw in real life. Ever.**\n\nDon't try to make yourself or someone you know into a meme.\n\nAlso, we do not allow witch hunts on the subreddit.\n\n_____\n\n##Rule 9: Use an approved host\n\n**Shortened links, Facebook, Tumblr, Blogspot, etc, will be automatically removed.**\n\nPlease use one of the approved websites listed on the sidebar to make your post.\n\n_____\n\n##Rule 10: Mods have the final say\n\n**We reserve the right to remove posts, remove comments, and ban users at our own discretion.**\n\nDue to the nature of the subreddit, interpretations of what is a meme and what is an image macro sometimes have different opinions and thus decisions have to be made.\n\n_____\n\n\n#[Always feel free to message the moderators if you have ANY questions!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAdviceAnimals)\n\n Moar code `this is code` ```(this is code too)```";
